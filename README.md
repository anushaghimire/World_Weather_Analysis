# Overview
The purpose of this project is to Retrieve weather data, create a costumer travel destination map, and create a travel itienerary map.
I used a customer's preference of minimum and maximum temperature of comfort to filter the cities and mark all the hotels within those cities using Google Maps API.
I also created a google direction API to create a travel  itienerary that shows the route between 4 cities chosen from the costumer's travel destination. Then I created a direction layer map and a marker layer map with a pop up marker for each cities.
